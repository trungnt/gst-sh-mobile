== 1. Release Notes  ==

Release date: Mon, 19 Oct 2009

Software version number: 1.4

Documentation version number: 0.2

Released architectures: SuperH (SH7723, SH4)

Released packages: gst-sh-mobile (1.4)

=== 1.1. Major Changes  ===

New Features and Fixes: 

o Doxygen documentation of encoder element.
o Encoder settings available as properties.

=== 1.2. Notes  ===

o Documentation for encoder, decoder and sink elements can be generated using 
  command: doxygen doxygen.conf.

o Previously encoder settings had to be given using a control file. Now all the
  same settings can be given using the property mechanism. Also each of the 
  properties have sensible default values, so the normally the user doesn't have
  to worry about them. The only exceptions are: stream type, width, height and
  frame rate. These must be set if not available in the caps of the stream.
  The possibility of using a control file is also still available.

=== 1.3. Known Issues  ===

o The encoder stream termination is currently implemented as a work around,
  because SHCodecs doesn't support returning from the encoder loop yet.

== 2. Results of the BAT Tests ==

All the BAT test cases are passed
