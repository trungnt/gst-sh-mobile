== 1. Release Notes  ==

Release date: Sun, 13 Sep 2009

Software version number: 1.2

Project milestone: 0.2

Released architectures: SuperH (SH7723, SH4)

Released packages: gst-sh-mobile (1.2)

=== 1.1. Major Changes  ===

New Features and Fixes: 

o Version numbering changed to continue the numbering started in the previous
  project. 

=== 1.2. Notes  ===

o This release was planned to include the fix in buffer handling which was 
  provided by Conrad Parker. However this fix was actually released already in
  the previous release. Thus, this is just a formal release to stay in line
  with the project plan and schedule.

=== 1.3. Known Issues  ===

o Support for upstream buffer allocation done in the sink element is not working
  currently. For some reason the parameter data gets corrupted when calling
  the buffer allocation function.
o A few blurry frames are visible during decoding of the H264 sample stream.
  Changing the buffer size doesn't have much effect on this.

== 2. Results of the BAT Tests ==

All the BAT test cases are passed
