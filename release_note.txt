== 1. Release Notes  ==

Release date: Wed, 9 Sep 2009

Version number: 0.1

Released architectures: SuperH (SH7723, SH4)

Released packages: gst-sh-mobile (0.1)

=== 1.1. Major Changes  ===

New Features and Fixes: 

o Decoder and sink implemented as separate elements
o Own buffer implemented for supporting zero copy functionality
o VEU API from Magnus Damm modified to suit our needs
o Fixed a bug in the input buffer handling. (Bug found by Renesas)
o Pre buffering removed from the decoder. Runtime buffering is still included.

=== 1.2. Notes  ===

o Work done in this project is a continuum to the work done in 
  AV Synchronization project
o This release concerns only the decoder and sink elements, although also
  encoder code is committed to the github.

=== 1.3. Known Issues  ===

o Support for upstream buffer allocation done in the sink element is not working
  currently. For some reason the parameter data gets corrupted when calling
  the buffer allocation function.
o A few blurry frames are visible during decoding of the H264 sample stream.
  Changing the buffer size doesn't have much effect on this.

== 2. Results of the BAT Tests ==

All the BAT test cases are passed
