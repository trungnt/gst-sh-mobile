== 1. Release Notes  ==

Release date: Sun, 4 Oct 2009

Software version number: 1.3

Documentation version number: 0.1

Project milestone: 0.3

Released architectures: SuperH (SH7723, SH4)

Released packages: gst-sh-mobile (1.3)

=== 1.1. Major Changes  ===

New Features and Fixes: 

o Doxygen documentation of decoder and sink elements.
o Encoder operation in stream mode.
o Bug in upstream buffer allocation fixed.

=== 1.2. Notes  ===

o Documentation for decoder and sink elements can be generated using command:
  doxygen doxygen.conf.

o Previously encoder was encoding a fixed number of frames for every stream.
  This was changed so that encoding will stop when GStreamer pipeline goes to
  paused state.

o Currently the elements support only NV12(YUV 4:2:0) color format. However the 
  SuperH architecture supports also several other color formats and the usability
  of our elements for 3rd party developers would increase a lot if more color
  formats were supported. Thus studies for adding more supported color formats
  were made. The result was that none of the other GStreamer color formats worked
  straight with the SuperH HW. The RGB packing used in the GStreamer would require
  only some byte moving operations (see below) so that might be more efficient
  than using color space conversion elements to convert RGB to NV12. This 
  possibility might be worth investigating in the future.

  GStreamer RGB pack:
  GGGB BBBB RRRR RGGG
  SuperH RGB pack:
  RRRR RGGG GGGB BBBB

o The video quality problem in H264 decoding that was reported in the previous
  release not seems to be actually a problem in the video sample as it was
  visible also when played with VLC player in PC.

=== 1.3. Known Issues  ===

o The encoder stream termination is currently implemented as a work around,
  because SHCodecs doesn't support returning from the encoder loop yet.
